<p class="question">Q: How are benefits calculated</p>
<p class="answer">
    A: Benefits are calculated on a per person basis. Each person that is part of the benifits package
    results in a deduction of $@ViewData["PerPerson"] from the base yearly benifits package. If this persons name begins
    with an 'A', a discount of @ViewData["Discount"]% is applied to their cost, in this case $@ViewData["AName"].

<p class="question">Q: Why is my paycheck not $2000</p>
<p class="answer">A: If you have enough dependents to overcome the $@ViewData["Benefits"] in benefits alloted to you
                     then your benefits will start to be paid for out of your paycheck.</p>

<p class="question">Q: How many paychecks do I get</p>
<p class="answer">A: Our company distributes a total of @ViewData["numChecks"] paychecks per year, in denominations of $@ViewData["PayCheck"]</p>
